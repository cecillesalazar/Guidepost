Guidepost is a daily advice app for anyone who wants to set an intention for their day.

Upon registration or login, you are presented with a randomly generated quirky piece of advice that you can ponder, act upon, or share in daily life!

You also have the option of creating your "own" custom guidepost for yourself. Perhaps, due to someone having shared with you a particularly good nugget of wisdom that you want to remember.

If you have created a few of your own, you may choose to receive your daily guidepost either through our collection or from your own. Simply toggle the view as desired by clicking the Get Guidepost button.

Namaste :)
